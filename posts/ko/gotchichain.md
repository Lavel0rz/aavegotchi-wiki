## What is Gotchichain based on?

Supernets are permissioned offshoots of the [Polygon](/polygon) POS network where any user can transact, but only certain developers can deploy contracts. This partnership will allow Aavegotchi to utilize Polygon's Supernets technology to create a blockchain optimized for gaming, with faster transaction times, lower gas fees, and superior scalability. In other words, Gotchichain will be the perfect launching ground for Aavegotchi-themed games and dapps.

## Gas Token

On Gotchichain, [GHST](/ghst) (Aavegotchi’s eco-governance token) will be the gas token for all transactions. All Aavegotchi assets will continue to be minted on Polygon POS, but can be bridged over to Gotchichain to be played in the new, gaming-friendly environment.

## Launch Date

Pixelcraft Studios is targeting an early Q3 2023 launch for Gotchichain.
